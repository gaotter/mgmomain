    <p>
        A singe page was easy to build. I just copied the index.html and renamed it to page-one.html. I did not
        want to have to copy the side bar to all pages. So I made a build js file that replaces the side bar by
        using nodejs.
        I could probably used a thired party tool like gulp or webpack. But that adds complexity.
