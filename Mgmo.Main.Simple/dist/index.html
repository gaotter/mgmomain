            This is just an experiment to help myself to learn more about complexity and why/when we need it.
            I have built web applications for some years now. Fist as a consultant mostly internal sites using
            SharePoint as a portal. Then moved to making React apps. The past years I have worked with a large
            portal app getting information about real estates. I really enjoyed it and like coding in Angular, React
            and .Net API’s. But it is complex, and there are always issues like a new version of Angular, npm, node
            etc. Plus, the complexity of the code. With is layering and dependency injections, interfaces. Then on
            the client side using service, rxjs pipes etc. Trying to make the js files as small as possible, by
            minifying and dynamic download of js files using modules etc. Angular has a lot of tools that does this
            automatically. And it is cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            I always had this “dumb” question in my mind why? Why do we need all these packages frameworks that has
            to be kept up to date. Does it need to be so complex. Searching Google, I find terms like it is more
            efficient better user experience, cashing of the script and css. Easier to develop. When I come to SPAs.
            It is probably true in many cases like for Netflix, Gmail etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even when I was doing Web Forms and MVC I had this question. My answer has been the bigger and smarter
            guys are doing it, it is “best practice”. It is the way we do it now. It’s so cool. I went with the
            flow, and feel I been part of many cool applications that are liked and used by thousands of users every
            day, and the code is manageable.
        </p>

            I looked at this talk (<a href="https://youtu.be/WN3CSOai_ZU"> The Silver Bullet Syndrome Part 2 -
                Complexity Strikes Back! - Hadi Hariri - NDC
                London 2022</a>) about just following the silver bullet hype, the get overwhelmed by complexity. And
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY6XqmMm4YA"
                target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY6XqmMm4YA</a> with Alan Kay and this thoughts
            about the web (I will try to
            learn more).
        </p>
        <p>
            So I let my inner question come back about why? When does the need for that complexity immerge, when do
            I hit the wall that justifies the complexity? I don’t know.

        <h2>The start</h2>
        <p>
            I will adjust as I learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal is to understand complexity in software engineering better, and how to make it as simple as
            possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            I need to read, not just code but read books, papers etc. I will come back to the books, blogs papers
            videos etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            To keep track of what I learn, is will build a simple site, trying to make it as simple as possible.
            Then track every step/problem and how it was solved. It’s just a web site and I’m the only developer, so
            it can’t compeer to large projects with portals, web sites APIs teams working on different
            parts/applications. But it’s a start.

        <h2>Making the first page</h2>
        <p>
            A fresh Angular project has over 300 MB of js files that I download using NPM. So even before the
            project is started you have a lot of dependencies, I do not control or even know about.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my simple web app, I just start by making the simple html page (5kb)
