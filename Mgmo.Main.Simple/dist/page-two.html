        It was easy to make the first page. Just write in the text into a html file done. But making page two is more
        difficult if I do not want to copy the same elements. Now I could use something like Next.js
        (https://nextjs.org/) to generate the html files for me, I think. Have not tried it, I will have to make a post
        about that.

        But letâ€™s try without, what do I need to do. I must have simple navigation, and the root html code is mostly the
        same, except from title and some meta-tags.

        It worked ok but I found that I would have some problems when adding many pages, if I needed to change the
        common parts of the app. Like the placement of the navigation etc. I still want to be able to write different
        title and meta data in the html file. But need to change the position of the side bar etc.
