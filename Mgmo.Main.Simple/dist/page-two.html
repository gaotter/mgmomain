        It was easy to make the first page. Just write in the text into a html file done. But making page two is more
        difficult if I do not want to copy the same elements. Now I could use something like Next.js
        (https://nextjs.org/) to generate the html files for me, I think. Have not tried it, I will have to make a post
        about that.

        But letâ€™s try without, what do I need to do. I must have simple navigation, and the root html code is mostly the
        same, except from title and some meta-tags.
    </p>
    <p>
        I made a simple nodeJs app that can generate the pages by reading a template file, and replace {{component}}
        bart with content of a html file with the same name as inside the {{compoenent}} text.
