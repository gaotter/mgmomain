    Disclaimer: This is just an experiment to help myself to learn more about complexity and why/when we need it. There
    is no best practices or methods one should use in larger projects. You should thing about over complexity, but many
    of the popular libraries like React, Angular, .Net Web apps, etc. Is made up of large teams and are widely used by
    thousands of developers every day. So choosing a framework is probably the best approach.
