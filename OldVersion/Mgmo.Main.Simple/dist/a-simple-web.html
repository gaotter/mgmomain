        This is just an experiment to help myself to learn more about complexity and why/when we need it. I have built
        web applications for some years now. First as a consultant mostly internal sites using SharePoint as a portal.
        Then moved to making React apps. The past years I have worked with a large portal app getting information about
        real estates. I really enjoyed it and like coding in Angular, React and .Net API’s. But it is complex, and there
        are always issues like a new version of Angular, npm, node etc. Plus, the complexity of the code. With is
        layering and dependency injections, interfaces. Then on the client side using service, rxjs pipes etc. Trying to
        make the js files as small as possible, by minifying and dynamic download of js files using modules etc. Angular
        has a lot of tools that does this automatically. And it is cool.
    </p>
    <p>
        I always had this “dumb” question in my mind why? Why do we need all these packages frameworks that has
        to be kept up to date. Does it need to be so complex. Searching Google, I find terms like it is more
        efficient better user experience, cashing of the script and css. Easier to develop. When I come to SPAs.
        It is probably true in many cases like for Netflix, Gmail etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even when I was doing Web Forms and MVC I had this question. My answer has been the bigger and smarter
        guys are doing it, it is “best practice”. It is the way we do it now. It’s so cool. I went with the
        flow, and feel I been part of many cool applications that are liked and used by thousands of users every
        day, and the code is manageable.

        I looked at this talk (<a href="https://youtu.be/WN3CSOai_ZU"> The Silver Bullet Syndrome Part 2 -
            Complexity Strikes Back! - Hadi Hariri - NDC
            London 2022</a>) about just following the silver bullet hype, the get overwhelmed by complexity. And
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY6XqmMm4YA"
            target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY6XqmMm4YA</a> with Alan Kay and this thoughts
        about the web (I will try to
        learn more).
    </p>
    <p>
        So I let my inner question come back about why? When does the need for that complexity immerge, when do
        I hit the wall that justifies the complexity? I don’t know.

    <h2>The start</h2>
    <p>
        I will adjust as I learn.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal is to understand complexity in software engineering better, and how to make it as simple as
        possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        I need to read, not just code but read books, papers etc. I will come back to the books, blogs papers
        videos etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        To keep track of what I learn, is will build a simple site, trying to make it as simple as possible.
        Then track every step/problem and how it was solved. It’s just a web site and I’m the only developer, so
        it can’t compeer to large projects with portals, web sites APIs teams working on different
        parts/applications. But it’s a start.

    <h2>Making the first page</h2>
    <p>
        A fresh Angular project has over 300 MB of js files that I download using NPM. So even before the
        project is started you have a lot of dependencies, I do not control or even know about.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my simple web app, I just start by making the simple html page (5kb)
